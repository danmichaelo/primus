**primus**

Proof-of-concept interface to search the [Brief Search API](https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/primo/apis/webservices/xservices/search/briefsearch) of the BIBSYS Primo installation.

Unfortunately, the API only allows connections from whitelisted IPs. 
I got my server whitelisted by sending an email to [Asbj√∏rn](http://bibsys.org/norsk/om_oss/ansatte/readMore.php?id=21)
